- I have a bit knowledge about the OP amp.
- OP Amp pins:
	- `VCC` take positive voltage source
	- `GND` release the negative voltage source
	- `Output` 
- But i still don't know yet about how to calculate the value of each component.

- Next i will try to calculate each component value for safety build a real object outside.
