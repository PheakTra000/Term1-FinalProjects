- I have a bit knowledge about the OP amp.
- OP Amp pins:
	- `VCC` take positive voltage source
	- `GND` release the negative voltage source
	- `Output` 
- But i still don't know yet about how to calculate the value of each component.

I figured out how to power the Op amp correct using two battery

- My schematic seems worked now 
- Next i will try to calculate each component value for safety build a real object outside.

- I don't know how to connect this wire cross like this on bread board.
- Whenever i connect the wire i cannot simulate it.

- I found a way to use Potential-meter to adjust the frequency.
	- On the Potential-meter itself, there are 3 pins:
		- Two terminal on the left and right side.
		- the other one is wiper (middle)
- So i will one terminal and the middle to let my potential act as only one resistor.
